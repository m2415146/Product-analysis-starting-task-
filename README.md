# Product-analysis-starting-task-
This is an initial assignment on the subject of "Product Design" in the Master's degree program of MISIS

## Main Task:

I need to describe 5 products that I personally like:  
* how do they solve problems?
* Why do I use them?
* Why do I like them?
* A brief analysis of competitors.
  
I also need to describe 5 products that I don't like, but I have to use them: 
* what problems are they created for?
* What's wrong with them?
* Are there any analogues?
* how to make it better?
  
It is highly recommended to use the [miro](https://miro.com)  and [figma](https://www.figma.com) tools to complete the task.

## Preparation

Since the miro and figma tools are new to me, I first need to figure out how to use them to complete the task. Miro will act as an online mind map, where I will describe the main points for each of the products, and miro will allow me to create a visualization in the form of a presentation. Of course, you first need to create a list of the products themselves.

The biggest problem came in the form of a list of products. The list of products you like should not look too banal. On the other hand, when making a list of negative products, the thought lies on the surface that I like everything I use - realizing that this is a mistake of thinking, I decided to make a list of those products that I use, but the disadvantages of which I have to put up with for various reasons - with this formulation, the task becomes much easier.

It may not be too organic, but the mind map and presentation will be done in Russian - because this is my native language and it's easier for me to make draft notes in it.

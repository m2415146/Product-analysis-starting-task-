# Product-analysis-starting-task-
This is an initial assignment on the subject of "Product Design" in the Master's degree program of MISIS

## Main Task:

I need to describe 5 products that I personally like:  
* how do they solve problems?
* Why do I use them?
* Why do I like them?
* A brief analysis of competitors.
  
I also need to describe 5 products that I don't like, but I have to use them: 
* what problems are they created for?
* What's wrong with them?
* Are there any analogues?
* how to make it better?
  
It is highly recommended to use the [miro](https://miro.com)  and [figma](https://www.figma.com) tools to complete the task.

## Preparation

Since the miro and figma tools are new to me, I first need to figure out how to use them to complete the task. Miro will act as an online mind map, where I will describe the main points for each of the products, and miro will allow me to create a visualization in the form of a presentation. Of course, you first need to create a list of the products themselves.

The biggest problem came in the form of a list of products. The list of products you like should not look too banal. On the other hand, when making a list of negative products, the thought lies on the surface that I like everything I use - realizing that this is a mistake of thinking, I decided to make a list of those products that I use, but the disadvantages of which I have to put up with for various reasons - with this formulation, the task becomes much easier.

It may not be too organic, but the mind map and presentation will be done in Russian - because this is my native language and it's easier for me to make draft notes in it.

## Making a list of products 

I used noteson my Iphone to do this part. I also tried to highlight the products that I use in my work and studies in order to train myself to analyze what I use in a field where efficiency is especially important to me.

## Creating a Mind map using Miro

this is my first experience interacting with Miro. I didn't look at the training materials, I started working with the service intuitively. For this reason, I cannot be sure that I have used the functionality adequately.

First, I chose a template that I thought would be suitable for structuring information on each of the products. The template was selected by me from the list of templates when I typed "product" in the search. in the screenshot, I marked the template I selected.

then I started filling out a template for products that I like. each block of cells contains the required product information. The template was copied by me and the second one contains information on the products that I need.

**Important notes and primary conclusions (Miro)**

* My analysis is rather superficial. This is because you need to understand the principle. Of course, there's a lot to go into here. For example, in competitor analysis. There really is something to do. In order to save time for the main task, I will leave it at the surface level. If, after a discussion with the teacher, he pays attention to the points that need to be changed, I will do it.


* I noticed that I had not highlighted the block with the problem sufficiently. If it is not highlighted separately, it is more difficult to answer the question "how should the product solve the problem?"

* At first, I want to make the "why do I use this" and "why do I like it" blocks almost identical, and at first I did so. but while filling in the blocks, I realized the difference between them, so the "why do I use this" block became a reflection of how the product solves my individual task.

* Definitely, during this assignment, I am not implementing all the miro functionality - for example, I do not find the relationship between different products, blocks. if I had performed the task more efficiently, then it would have been possible to draw conclusions from there - for example, why did I choose these products? is this related to the tasks at this stage of my life for me? I think based on this, it would be possible to make an approximate description of consumers of the same social group to which I belong.

* I will try to rationalize these and the following points when performing the next task, when the development of a specific product is required.
